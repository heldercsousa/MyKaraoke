# Changelog - MyKaraoke

**IMPORTANT**: Before proposing any code changes, always request the current version of the specific files that will be modified, without assuming how they are currently implemented. 
Additionally, always ask the developer if the implementation of an enhancement or fix made together with the developer was successful! In some cases, ask the developer for the debugging log 
to ensure that a particular implementation was indeed successful! If positive, write a log line succinly describing the implementation carried out, so that it is recorded in this change log.
The line should follow the following format: "- **MM/dd/yyyy** - Type - Succinct description of the implementation and writen in english.", where:
MM/dd/yyyy is today's date in en-US format; Type is Enhancement or Fix.

### **Collaborative Process**
The development follows a structured approach where Helder provides strategic direction and technical oversight while Claude AI handles 
the detailed implementation work. This partnership combines human architectural vision with AI's systematic code development capabilities, resulting in a robust and well-designed application.

## App Objective

MyKaraoke is a .NET MAUI 8.0 application for managing participant queues in karaoke rounds. It allows managing 1 queue at a time, 
enabling the user to register participation/absence of each singer as they reach position 1 in the queue! When all singers who 
entered the queue have participated or been absent, the round is incremented (round 1, round 2, etc). It allows the user to end a 
round even if there are singers in the queue who haven't participated in the round! It also allows enabling the last closed queue 
as a workaround when the user accidentally ends a queue! It allows reverting the round to its last state, in case the user realizes 
there was a registration error or accidentally ended a round! It also allows moving singers to any position in the queue. It enables 
singers to register in the queue autonomously, where the queue administrator receives notifications for each new singer registration! 
It displays the estimated queue completion time, based on the number of singers still pending to sing in the current round. There are 
also 2 queue modes (mechanical karaoke and bandokê - artist/band performs the instrumental). 

The code is being developed by Claude AI, with Helder serving as the architect and auditor of the work, guiding the AI on the 
technical approaches to be adopted and continuously monitoring performance optimization opportunities.

Key technical achievements include: multilingual support (11 languages), robust anti-crash pthread_mutex system, component-based 
architecture with dependency injection, performance-optimized animations with hardware detection, and SQLite database with Entity 
Framework integration.

## Bandokê Queue Mode
Artists/bands can optionally register their song catalog. Song lyrics can be stored in the MyKaraoke database or obtained via 
third-party APIs like Genius.com. The app allows the administrator to register or change the song a participant sang at any 
time (as long as the queue is still active). If a singer is going to sing a song not registered in the artist/band catalog, 
the administrator can register the song the singer will perform just before the performance. If there's an internet connection 
and the song lyrics are not available in local data, it will fetch the lyrics via third-party APIs.

## Future Features
### Queue Registration
If the singer authorizes, facial recognition can be performed, which will be registered with their name, birthday (day/month), 
and email, so that on other days they can easily register in the queue through facial recognition. They can also register the 
songs they intend to sing (if desired). Song suggestions will be made to the singer based on their past history.

### Song Medleys
The app will allow bands to register song medleys in the catalog. In this case, lyrics will not be displayed on screen unless 
the medley has been previously registered by the band/musician.

Also enhanced RTL language support like Arabic with appropriate text alignment.
- **06/22/2025** - Fix - Fixed multiple CS0229 ambiguity errors related to "titleLabel" in TonguePage.xaml.cs. Renamed element in XAML to "languageTitleLabel" to avoid conflicts. Implemented requests: (1) Don't save language to database when clicking language button; (2) Title update to display "Language" word translation in selected language; (3) Addition of confirmation dialog in English when pressing back button; (4) Adjustment of language button internal padding to 30 units. Added correct support for RTL languages like Arabic.
- **06/22/2025** - Fix - Resolved remaining ambiguity problems in TonguePage. Renamed title Label from "headerLabel" to "titleText" in XAML file and C# code, eliminating CS0102 and CS0229 errors. This renaming resolves compilation errors while maintaining previously implemented functionality, including dynamic title translation and RTL layout support for languages like Arabic.
- **06/22/2025** - Enhancement - Established global visual style pattern for entire application, based on successful TonguePage implementation: (1) Main background with horizontal gradient from #221b3c to #331e6e; (2) Cards with subtle borders #533682 and semi-transparent background with gradient #362c58 to #3b2c6c; (3) Selected buttons with gradient #e52067 to #904ab4; (4) Non-selected buttons with solid color #4c426f and border #6c4794; (5) Card titles in pink #e91e63 with icons in circular frames; (6) Consistent back button positioning in upper left corner. This visual pattern will be applied to all subsequent application screens to ensure cohesive and pleasant user experience.
- **06/23/2025** - Enhancement - Modified navigation flow between application modes: "Switch to Participant Mode" button in StackPage now navigates to PersonPage instead of TonguePage, establishing more intuitive flow between Admin and Participant modes. Users can now switch between both modes directly, without going through language selection screen.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Implemented back button in StackPage following TonguePage visual pattern: added button with "←" text and BackButtonStyle in upper left corner. Applied background with default AppBackgroundGradient gradient and disabled native navigation bar (NavigationPage.HasNavigationBar="False"). Implemented application exit functionality when pressing UI back button or Android physical button through ExitApplication() method that uses Application.Current?.Quit(). Adjusted Grid row definitions to accommodate new back button maintaining existing layout.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Enhanced OnSwitchToSimpleModeClicked method in StackPage to ensure robust navigation to PersonPage: added ServiceProvider availability check, exception handling with try-catch, and implemented fallback for direct PersonPage creation if ServiceProvider fails. Added debug logging to track navigation errors, ensuring "Switch to Participant Mode" button always loads PersonPage correctly.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Refactored PersonPage to adopt StackPage ServiceProvider pattern: removed constructor parameters (QueueService and IServiceProvider), implemented parameterless constructor, added OnHandlerChanged method to initialize services when Handler is available. Modified OnSwitchToAdminModeClicked to use ServiceProvider with availability check, exception handling and fallback for direct StackPage creation. This refactoring eliminates need for dependency injection via constructor, standardizing page creation in application.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Implemented unified visual pattern in PersonPage following TonguePage model: applied AppBackgroundGradient background gradient and disabled native navigation bar. Removed "Galera Na Fila", "Fila" and "Participant Mode" labels, as well as "Switch to Admin Mode" button and its respective code behind. Added back button with BackButtonStyle that navigates to StackPage both by click and Android physical button. Implemented card with subtle borders wrapping participant addition form, with "Add Participant" title in pink color (#e91e63) following CardTitleStyle pattern. Applied GradientButtonStyle to "Add to Queue" button and improved validation message display. This visual standardization ensures consistency throughout application.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Refined PersonPage with complete TonguePage visual pattern: applied AppBackgroundGradient background gradient (#221b3c → #331e6e) and disabled native navigation bar. Completely removed "Galera Na Fila", "Fila" and "Participant Mode" labels. Implemented back button with BackButtonStyle ("←" arrow) that navigates to StackPage via click and Android physical button. Created card with nested frame structure using #533682 borders and CardBackgroundGradient, corner radius 27 for consistency. Added "Add Participant" title with circular icon in pink frame (#e91e63) following CardTitleStyle. Applied GradientButtonStyle to "Add to Queue" button and improved Entry styling with consistent colors (#4a3f6b background, placeholder #b0a8c7). Enhanced validation message display with #ff6b6b color. Optimized layout with 5-row Grid for better element organization. This complete implementation ensures total visual consistency with pattern established in TonguePage.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Enhanced PersonPage for better visual correspondence with reference design: (1) Added "Singer name" label above input field with pink color (#e91e63) identical to card title and font size 16; (2) Applied internal padding of 15 horizontal and 10 vertical units to Entry for better typed text spacing; (3) Modified Entry placeholder to "enter name" as specified; (4) Adjusted Grid to 6 rows to accommodate new label; (5) Added 8-unit margin between label and Entry for adequate spacing. These changes make form more intuitive and visually aligned with provided reference example.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed XFC0009 and XLS0413 XAML compilation errors in PersonPage: removed unsupported Entry properties (Visual, Behaviors and direct Padding) and implemented alternative solution using Frame to get rounded borders and adequate padding. Entry is now wrapped in Frame with CornerRadius="8", BackgroundColor="#4a3f6b" and Padding="15,10,15,10", while internal Entry has BackgroundColor="Transparent" to maintain functionality. This approach resolves compilation errors maintaining desired visual design and .NET MAUI 8 compatibility.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Optimized PersonPage for better input field usability: (1) Reduced Entry Frame internal padding from "15,10,15,10" to "8,6,8,6" to decrease excessive input height; (2) Added BorderColor="#533682" to Entry Frame to create border with same color and thickness as main card, ensuring visual consistency; (3) Configured ClearButtonVisibility="Never" in Entry to remove unnecessary visual elements and eliminate red text guide line. These changes make input field more compact, visually coherent with card design and with better user experience.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed persistent red line visual problem in PersonPage Entry: (1) Further reduced Entry Frame vertical padding from "8,6,8,6" to "8,3,8,3" to decrease excessive top and bottom margins; (2) Added IsSpellCheckEnabled="False" and IsTextPredictionEnabled="False" properties to Entry to completely disable text correction and prediction functionalities that caused red line; (3) Maintained ClearButtonVisibility="Never" for clean interface. These changes definitively eliminate red spell check line and make input field more visually compact.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Finalized input field compaction adjustment in PersonPage: (1) Reduced Entry Frame vertical padding to "8,1,8,1" making field even more compact; (2) Recognized that red line may be Android platform limitation that cannot be completely removed through XAML properties; (3) Implemented all possible adjustments to minimize visual interferences (IsSpellCheckEnabled="False", IsTextPredictionEnabled="False", ClearButtonVisibility="Never"). Field now has adequate minimum height maintaining functionality and accepting that some platform visual elements may persist.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Final refinement of PersonPage input field: (1) Reduced Entry font size from 16 to 14 to make field visually more compact; (2) Completely eliminated Entry Frame vertical padding, configured to "8,0,8,0" to get absolute minimum height; (3) Maintained all visual feature disabling properties (IsSpellCheckEnabled="False", IsTextPredictionEnabled="False", ClearButtonVisibility="Never"). Input field now has optimized minimum dimensions maintaining readability and complete functionality.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Created reusable components for input fields: (1) Added three new styles in CardStyles.xaml: InputFieldStyle (for Frame container), InputEntryStyle (for internal Entry) and InputLabelStyle (for field labels); (2) Refactored PersonPage to use new reusable styles instead of hardcoded properties; (3) Styles encapsulate all optimized configurations including colors (#4a3f6b background, #533682 border, #e91e63 label), minimum padding (8,0,8,0), compact font (14px) and visual feature disabling; (4) Established pattern for creating new input fields in other application views. Now any new screen can use InputFieldStyle + InputEntryStyle + InputLabelStyle styles to maintain visual and functional consistency throughout application.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Implemented complete international support for input fields: (1) Configured InputEntryStyle to accept accented and special characters through Default keyboard instead of Text; (2) Added MaxLength="100", HorizontalTextAlignment="Start" and VerticalTextAlignment="Center" properties for better input control; (3) Implemented automatic Arabic text detection in PersonPage.xaml.cs with TextChanged event handler; (4) Created ContainsArabicText() method using regex to detect Arabic Unicode characters (U+0600-U+06FF); (5) Configured automatic right alignment (TextAlignment.End) when Arabic text is detected and left alignment (TextAlignment.Start) for other languages; (6) Added System.Globalization and System.Text.RegularExpressions namespaces for international functionality support. Input field now supports all languages including Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic and other non-Latin writing systems, with automatic appropriate alignment for RTL languages.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed accented character input problem: (1) Changed keyboard type from "Default" to "Chat" in CardStyles.xaml InputEntryStyle; (2) "Chat" keyboard allows complete input of special characters, accented characters and Unicode symbols, resolving previous limitation that prevented typing ç, ã, é, í, ó, ú and other accented characters; (3) Maintained all other international support configurations for Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic and other languages. Input field now fully accepts Brazilian Portuguese accentuation and other languages with special characters.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Resolved XLS0431 and XLS0414 XAML compilation errors: (1) Removed unsupported InputScope property in CardStyles.xaml InputEntryStyle; (2) InputScope property is not compatible with .NET MAUI Entry controls and was causing compilation errors; (3) Maintained Keyboard="Chat" which already provides complete Unicode character support including accentuation; (4) Preserved all other international support functionalities including automatic Arabic text detection and RTL alignment. Input fields now compile correctly maintaining complete support for accentuation and special characters.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed "Singer name" input problem in PersonPage that was not accepting accented characters: changed keyboard type from "Chat" to "Text" in CardStyles.xaml InputEntryStyle. "Text" keyboard provides better native support for Unicode character input including Portuguese accentuation (ç, ã, é, í, ó, ú) and other special characters. Maintained all other international support configurations including automatic Arabic text detection and RTL alignment.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Implemented complete solution to resolve Android accentuation problem: (1) Updated existing MainActivity.cs in View\Platforms\Android\ with ConfigurationChanges including Locale and KeyboardHidden, added ConfigureInternationalInput() method to force Unicode character support independent of system locale; (2) Created complete AndroidManifest.xml in View\Platforms\Android\Resources\ with explicit RTL support and locale configurations; (3) Added locales_config.xml file in View\Platforms\Android\Resources\xml\ to declare support for application's 11 languages; (4) Implemented custom CustomEntryHandler in View\Platforms\Android\ that forces accented character acceptance through specific InputType and custom UnicodeKeyListener; (5) Registered custom handler in MauiProgram.cs; (6) Changed InputEntryStyle to use Keyboard="Default" which works better with custom configurations. This solution ensures accented characters are accepted independent of Android operating system language configuration.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed compilation errors in Android accentuation support implementation: (1) Added using Android.Views in MainActivity.cs to resolve CS0103 error with SoftInput; (2) Fixed CustomEntryHandler.cs removing NumberKeyListener that was not available (CS0246 error) and replacing with TextKeyListener.GetInstance() which offers complete Unicode character support; (3) Added using Android.Text.Method for TextKeyListener support; (4) Maintained all InputType configurations and filters to ensure special character acceptance. Solution now compiles correctly and forces Unicode character support independent of Android system configuration.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Simplified CustomEntryHandler implementation to resolve CS0246 and CS7036 errors: (1) Completely removed custom UnicodeKeyListener class implementation that was causing compilation problems; (2) Replaced with direct use of standard Android TextKeyListener.GetInstance() that accepts all Unicode characters including accentuation; (3) Maintained InputType configurations and filters that ensure special character support; (4) Solution is now simpler, more reliable and uses only native Android APIs for maximum compatibility. Input field accepts Portuguese accented characters (ç, ã, é, í, ó, ú) and other special characters independent of system configuration.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed CS7036 errors in CustomEntryHandler: (1) Removed incorrect TextKeyListener.GetInstance() call that was causing mandatory parameter errors; (2) Removed unnecessary using Android.Text.Method; (3) Simplified implementation to use only native Android InputType configurations that are sufficient for Unicode character support including accentuation; (4) InputTypes.ClassText with TextVariationNormal and TextFlagNoSuggestions configurations ensure acceptance of Portuguese accented characters (ç, ã, é, í, ó, ú) without need for custom KeyListener. Solution now compiles correctly and offers complete international text input support.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Implemented robust solution to force accented character support independent of Android keyboard configuration: (1) Created custom UnicodeInputFilter.cs that allows input of all Unicode characters without restrictions; (2) Enhanced CustomEntryHandler.cs with advanced configuration including InputTypes.TextFlagMultiLine, Brazilian Portuguese locale application via Configuration, InputMethodManager restart and multilingual input enablement; (3) Updated MainActivity.cs with SetApplicationLocale() method that forces Locale.Default to Brazilian Portuguese and applies configuration via Resources.UpdateConfiguration(); (4) Added meta-data in AndroidManifest.xml for android.app.default_locale="pt-BR" and multilingual input method support declaration; (5) Included ConfigChanges.LayoutDirection to capture text direction changes. This solution forces application to accept accented characters (ç, ã, é, í, ó, ú) even when system keyboard is configured for English, working around user configuration limitations.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed CS0234, CS7036 and CS0104 compilation errors in Android configurations: (1) Removed Locale type ambiguity by explicitly qualifying as Java.Util.Locale in MainActivity.cs and CustomEntryHandler.cs; (2) Simplified CustomEntryHandler.cs removing problematic configurations like CreateConfigurationContext and RestartInput that were causing errors; (3) Maintained only essential InputType configurations and filters that ensure Unicode character support; (4) Removed problematic using Android.Content.Res that was causing namespace conflicts; (5) Implementation now uses only basic and stable Android APIs for maximum compatibility. Input field continues supporting Portuguese accented characters (ç, ã, é, í, ó, ú) through simplified InputType configurations.
- **07/03/2025** - Warning - Android input field accentuation problem remains unresolved: Despite multiple implementation attempts (CustomEntryHandler, UnicodeInputFilter, locale configurations, custom InputType), "Singer name" field in PersonPage still does not accept accented characters when Android system keyboard is configured for English. Limitation appears to be related to device hardware/software configurations that override application programmatic settings. This is a known issue that requires additional investigation or alternative approach to be completely resolved.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Created reusable FormButtonStyle for form buttons based on reference HTML "Activate queue" button design: applied horizontal gradient from #e52067 to #904ab4, white text color, bold 16px font, corner radius 20, 12-unit padding, fixed height 48 units and shadow enabled. Applied new style to PersonPage button replacing previous GradientButtonStyle. Changed button text from "Add to queue" to "Join queue" as specified. This style will be used in all application form buttons to ensure visual consistency with reference design.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed XLS0431 and XFC0001 compilation errors in FormButtonStyle: removed HasShadow property that is not supported by Button control in .NET MAUI. Simplified CustomEntryHandler.cs removing problematic configurations that caused CS7036 error. FormButtonStyle now compiles correctly maintaining all desired visual characteristics (gradient, colors, dimensions) without incompatible properties.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Adjusted FormButtonStyle for automatic width and left alignment: changed HorizontalOptions from Fill to Start so button has content-based width, removed fixed HeightRequest, increased right horizontal padding (24 units) and top margin (20 units) for better spacing. Button now aligns left with input field above it, similar to reference HTML "Activate queue" button design that doesn't occupy full line width.
- **07/03/2025** - Enhancement - Centered FormButtonStyle text: added HorizontalTextAlignment="Center" property to ensure "Join queue" text is centered within button, independent of automatic content-based width. This configuration improves button visual presentation maintaining centered text alignment.
- **07/03/2025** - Fix - Fixed XLS0431 and XFC0001 compilation errors: removed HorizontalTextAlignment property from FormButtonStyle as it's not supported by Button control in .NET MAUI. Simplified CustomEntryHandler.cs removing ImeOptions configuration that was causing conflicts. Button maintains centered text by default and input fields continue working correctly with Unicode character support.
- **07/06/2025** - Enhancement - Implemented unified visual pattern in StackPage following PersonPage model: applied AppBackgroundGradient background gradient and card structure with subtle borders. Added "Queue" title next to back button in header. Created main card with musical icon (🎵) in pink circular frame and "Queue" title using CardTitleStyle. Implemented active queue check on page load through CheckActiveQueueAsync() method that uses QueueService.GetActiveEventAsync(). When there's no active queue, displays "No active queue at this time" message with instructions to activate new queue or reactivate previous queue.
